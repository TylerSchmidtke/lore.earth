+++

two field recordings from early 2024, captured during quiet moments in natural settings. the first piece documents the steady flow of water over stone, while the second captures the interaction between human activity and the natural rhythm of water.

these recordings were made with minimal processing, preserving the authentic character of each environment. headphones recommended for the full spatial experience.
